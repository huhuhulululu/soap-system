  边界案例: V02 规则无变化测试。

  关键边界:
  - Tightness: moderate → moderate (保持不变)
  - V02 规则: 仅检查 tightness 恶化
  - 无变化不触发 V02

  测试目的:
  验证审查系统 V02 规则行为:
  - Tightness 保持不变: 不触发 (PASS)
  - Tightness 改善: 不触发 (PASS)
  - Tightness 恶化: 触发 WARNING

  临床意义:
  治疗进展中,pain 和 ROM 改善,但 tightness 尚未改善。
  这是正常的治疗反应,tightness 通常改善较慢。

  预期行为:
  V02 不触发, 整体审查结果 PASS
