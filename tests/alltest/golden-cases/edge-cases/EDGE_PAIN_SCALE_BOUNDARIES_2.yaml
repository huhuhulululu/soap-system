notes: |
  边界案例: AC-3.2 规则上限边界测试。

  关键边界:
  - best = 4, current = 8, worst = 8
  - AC-3.2 规则: best ≤ current ≤ worst
  - current = worst (上限), 刚好满足

  测试目的:
  验证审查系统正确处理 pain scale 边界:
  - current = worst 应该 PASS
  - current > worst 应该触发 AC-3.2 FAIL

  临床意义:
  患者当前处于最严重状态 (疼痛最重时),
  合理的初诊场景,患者在疼痛高峰期寻求治疗。

  预期行为:
  AC-3.2 检查 PASS, 整体审查结果 PASS
