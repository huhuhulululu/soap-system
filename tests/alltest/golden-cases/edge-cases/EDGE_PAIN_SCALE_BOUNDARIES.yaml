  边界案例: AC-3.2 规则下限边界测试。

  关键边界:
  - best = 5, current = 5, worst = 7
  - AC-3.2 规则: best ≤ current ≤ worst
  - current = best (下限), 刚好满足

  测试目的:
  验证审查系统正确处理 pain scale 边界:
  - current = best 应该 PASS
  - current < best 应该触发 AC-3.2 FAIL

  临床意义:
  患者当前处于最佳状态 (疼痛最轻时),
  这是合理的初诊场景。

  预期行为:
  AC-3.2 检查 PASS, 整体审查结果 PASS
