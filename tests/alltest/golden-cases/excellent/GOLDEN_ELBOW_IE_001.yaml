notes: |
  Excellent IE for tennis elbow with clear Damp-Heat presentation.
  All IE requirements met (pain=7, severity/chronicity/condition all standard).
  Comprehensive functional assessment (grip strength, ADL impact).
  Pattern diagnosis well-supported: warmth + red tongue + rapid pulse = Damp-Heat.
  Treatment appropriately avoids heat (contraindicated in Damp-Heat).
  Good integration of Western diagnosis (lateral epicondylitis) with TCM pattern.
